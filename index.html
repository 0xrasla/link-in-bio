          Once upon a time, in a far-off desert, a baby was found all alone by a
          group of animals. The animals decided to raise the child as their own.
          As the child grew up, it became clear that they had an affinity for
          technology and coding. They would spend hours tinkering with sticks
          and stones, trying to build rudimentary machines. One day, a group of
          travelers came by and saw the child's creations. They were amazed by
          the child's ingenuity and offered to take them to the city to learn
          more about technology and coding. The child was hesitant at first,
          having never been outside the desert, but eventually, they agreed. In
          the city, the child discovered a passion for programming. They spent
          countless hours learning various programming languages and building
          their own programs. Before long, the child became a talented
          programmer, known throughout the city for their skills. And thus, the
          child who was once raised by animals in the desert became a renowned
          programmer, thanks to the skills they learned from their furry
          friends. wonder who is this guy ?! yeah! you know me LOL!
